    "\n",
    "Your task is to **design, justify, and build a fully functional chatbot** using **Groq LLMs**. Follow the steps below carefully and document every choice you make.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Choose a Use Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose a **Travel Planner Bot** that helps users plan trips (itineraries, attractions, tips).  \n",
    "- **Target Users:** Students, professionals, and families who want quick trip suggestions.  \n",
    "- **Benefits:** Saves time, offers personalized recommendations, and is available 24/7.  \n",
    "- **Limitations:** Cannot book tickets/hotels, limited to text suggestions, may lack real-time prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Justify Your Choice**\n",
    "\n",
    " **Why a chatbot?**  \n",
    "  Many people want fast travel advice without browsing 10+ websites. A chatbot gives instant Q&A.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why not an app/website?**  \n",
    "  Apps require installation and learning curve. A chatbot feels natural, interactive, and is cross-platform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tasks chatbot will perform:**  \n",
    "  - Suggest itineraries for 2‚Äì7 days.  \n",
    "  - Recommend attractions, food, and activities.  \n",
    "  - Provide packing or safety tips.  \n",
    "  - Answer general travel FAQs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Select the LLM (Use Groq)**\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use **`\"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\"   # stable, versatile model` on Groq** because:  \n",
    "- **Fast inference** ‚Üí real-time travel advice.  \n",

    "- **English-focused** ‚Üí perfect since most queries are in English.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Design the Conversation Flow**\n",

    "**Sample Interaction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greeting**  \n",
    "  User: *Hi*  \n",

    "  User: *Thanks, bye*  \n",
    "  Bot: *Safe travels! ‚úàÔ∏è Have a great trip.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory:** Stateless (no long memory) ‚Üí keeps it simple and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Choose a Prompting Technique**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used **System Prompt Design + Few-Shot Prompting**.  \n",
    "- **System Prompt:** The bot is a *friendly travel planner*.  \n",
    "- **Few-Shot Examples:** Show it how to structure itineraries and responses.  \n",
