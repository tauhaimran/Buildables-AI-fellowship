    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs how iteration works in action. Consider this example prompt: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Identify the latest developments in the restaurant industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs a simple prompt that only includes the task, and it might generate some broad insights, but chances are that you‚Äôll need to iterate in order to get an output closer to what you want. You can try these four iteration methods to generate more useful outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Revisit the prompting framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your prompt is clear about your desired task and includes a specific persona and format, plenty of context, and offers relevant references that help inform the output. Here‚Äôs an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a bulleted list including the latest developments in the restaurant industry specific to urban areas that could impact the public reception of a dining experience using only ingredients native to the region. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Break the prompt into shorter sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of packing everything into a complex and lengthy prompt, address each individual step in a separate prompt until you‚Äôve accomplished everything:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompt one:** Create a bulleted list including the latest developments in the restaurant industry.\n",
    "- **Prompt two:** Summarize the trends that would specifically impact restaurants in urban areas.\n",
    "- **Prompt three:** Write a pros and cons list on how those developments could impact the public reception of a dining experience using only ingredients native to the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Tweak your phrasing or switch to an analogous task\n",
    "\n",
    "Shift your language to explain what you mean in a different way. Or, try a different task that‚Äôs similar to what you‚Äôre trying to complete but different enough to trigger a new response. Here‚Äôs an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I‚Äôm starting a restaurant that will only include produce from within 50 miles. You‚Äôre a diner that lives in a major city and keeps up with the latest restaurant trends. Write a list of questions that I should consider before opening up the restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Introduce constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus the gen AI tool‚Äôs output by adding constraints, or limitations, to your prompt. When you set boundaries for specific categories, lengths, formats, or other details in your prompt, you help the tool provide a more precise output. It‚Äôs like asking for a list of food recipes but specifying that the recipe should only use seasonal ingredients and take less than 30 minutes to prepare. Adding constraints can actually encourage more inventive, targeted results that better match your needs. Here‚Äôs an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Create a bulleted list including the latest developments in the restaurant industry specific to urban areas that could impact the public reception of a dining experience using only ingredients native to the region. This list should only include trends from cities with a population of more than 500,000 people, and should only include trends relevant to vegetarian and vegan restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of the four methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revisit framework  \n",
    "- Shorten prompt  \n",
    "- Add constraints  \n",
    "- Tweak phrasing or switch to analogous task\n",
    "\n",
    "When providing guidance to a gen AI tool, it‚Äôs important to know the right direction to point it in. Whether you‚Äôre adhering more closely to the prompting framework, dividing a longer prompt into a few shorter ones, applying constraints, or re-phrasing your prompt as a similar task, iteration is the key to troubleshooting your prompt design and targeting the output you need."

    "## **Images and visuals can be as important as words when you want to communicate ideas**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use generative AI tools to create visuals. So far, I've asked gen AI tools to produce responses in what's called a **text-based modality**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Modalities** are the different formats in which gen AI tools receive or produce information ‚Äî whether that's text, images, video, audio, or code. Different gen AI tools are better at working in certain modalities. Be sure to check the gen AI tool you're using to find out which modalities it's capable of using or producing. \n",
    "\n",
    "### - Image generation basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Some gen AI tools can create images ‚Äî a sunrise üåÖ, a bouquet of flowers üíê, or even a crab riding a dolphin ü¶Äüê¨. But those same tools can also make images for a business or a professional presentation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "Maybe you're a musician üé∏ playing a gig in New Orleans and you want to promote your concert. You could use a gen AI tool to help you create a **poster** to advertise the show.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### - Prompting for text\n",
    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs prompt the AI to create both text and images so we can discuss the subtle differences between prompting for each modality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Start with text first. Remember the **thoughtfully, create, really, excellent, inputs framework**.  \n",
    "Text-based prompts work best when we **specify our task and add clear context**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Generate headlines for a poster promoting a rock concert in New Orleans.  \n",
    "> The concert is one night only, and the headlines should encourage the audience not to miss out.  \n",
    "\n",
    "üí° This guides the AI toward more relevant and catchy text-based outputs, like:  \n",
    "**‚ÄúNOLA. This is it: Unforgettable Rock, One Night Only.‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Prompting for images\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in order to prompt the AI for an **image**, we need to tweak our language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We‚Äôll still use the prompting framework, but we must provide more **vivid descriptions** that help the AI determine the type of image it needs to create. This means specifying:  \n",
    "- **Size**  \n",
    "- **Color**  \n",
    "- **Position of elements**  \n",
    "- **Overall aesthetic**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Generate an image of an electric guitar for a poster.  \n",
    "> It should be a photographic style. The guitar should be glittery or sparkly ‚ú® and create a sense of excitement.  \n",
    "> The guitar should be in the foreground and give a sense that it's floating in the sky üåå.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### - Iterating and refining images\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these images even better, you can **iterate and refine** your prompt:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example refinement:  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Now, make the sky stormy ‚õàÔ∏è with lightning ‚ö° hitting the guitar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By continuing to **evaluate and iterate**, you can keep adding relevant details from each new output until you get one that works perfectly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Key takeaway:**  \n",
    "When prompting for images, **be specific, descriptive, and iterative**. Start with a clear task, then refine step by step until you achieve the desired result.\n"

    "\n",
    "So far, we‚Äôve focused on text prompts ‚Äî but you can also use **other types of media** as part of your prompts. This is called **multimodal prompting**. It means combining different formats (like images, audio, or documents) with text to guide a generative AI tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is Multimodal Prompting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal prompting is using **different types of input** together with text.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- üñºÔ∏è **Images + Text:** Upload a chart and ask AI to explain the data in plain language.  \n",
    "- üé® **Design references:** Share different logo options and ask for more choices in similar styles.  \n",
    "- üéß **Audio + Text:** Upload an audio clip in another language and ask for a transcription or translation.  \n",
    "- üìÑ **Documents:** Provide a schedule, floor plan, or report and ask AI to extract specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1: Marketing with Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you‚Äôre an entrepreneur selling **nail art designs**.  \n",

    "## **Using Generative AI Responsibly**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI tools are powerful, but like any tool, they should be used thoughtfully and responsibly ‚Äî especially in professional settings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Align with Goals and Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "Before using gen AI, ask yourself:  \n",
    "- Does this task align with my goals, responsibilities, and obligations?  \n",
    "- Am I following my organization‚Äôs policies and any relevant local laws?  \n",
    "- Is gen AI the right tool for this job, or should I consider another approach?  \n",
    "\n",
    "If the answer is **no**, rethink how (or whether) to use AI for the task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Protect Confidential and Personal Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Check your company‚Äôs rules before entering **confidential or sensitive information**.  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Use enterprise or approved versions of tools when available.  \n",
    "- ‚ùå Avoid entering private personal data into **publicly available** tools.  \n",
    "- ‚úÖ Always check how your data will be used or stored.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evaluate Outputs for Accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI can produce:  \n",
    "- **Errors** ‚Äî factual mistakes or incorrect details.  \n",
    "- **Hallucinations** ‚Äî outputs that are inconsistent, nonsensical, or fabricated.  \n",
    "\n",
    "These often happen when prompts are vague or unclear. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs crucial to:  \n",
    "- Fact-check and cross-reference information.  \n",
    "- Compare outputs against reliable sources.  \n",
    "- Maintain a **human-in-the-loop** approach, where a person always verifies before using the output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Iterate Carefully\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes AI takes prompts too literally. For example, if you prompt for ‚Äúcats on a rocket,‚Äù the tool might place cats on top of the rocket rather than inside. Iterating with **clearer instructions** can refine the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Watch for Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI can unintentionally reflect stereotypes or unfair representations. To reduce bias:  \n",
    "- Write **specific, detailed prompts**.  \n",
    "- Use **inclusive language** that avoids stereotypes.  \n",
    "- Example: Instead of ‚Äúserviceman‚Äù or ‚Äúworkman,‚Äù use ‚Äúservice person‚Äù or ‚Äúworker.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures outputs are fair and inclusive of all backgrounds, genders, and ethnicities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Takeaway**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative AI is not a replacement for human judgment.  \n",
    "It cannot think critically or understand nuance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your role is to:  \n",
    "- Verify outputs üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  \n",

    "\n",
    "### Strategies to Mitigate Hallucinations  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fact-Check Outputs**  \n",
