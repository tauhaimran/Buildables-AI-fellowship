# Anatomy Basics — short notes

## Rotator cuff
The rotator cuff consists of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis.
- Function: stabilize the glenohumeral joint and enable rotation of the humerus.
- Supraspinatus: abduction initiation.
- Infraspinatus & teres minor: external rotation.
- Subscapularis: internal rotation.

## Cranial nerves (short)
I - Olfactory: smell.
II - Optic: vision.
III - Oculomotor: most eye movements, pupil constriction.
IV - Trochlear: superior oblique muscle (eye movement).
V - Trigeminal: face sensation, mastication.
VI - Abducens: lateral rectus muscle (abducts eye).
VII - Facial: facial expression, taste anterior 2/3 tongue.
VIII - Vestibulocochlear: hearing and balance.🧠 Anatomy Basics — Expanded Notes (RAG-Friendly)
1. Rotator Cuff — Detailed Notes

The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles that stabilize the shoulder (glenohumeral joint) and allow complex arm movements.
They are often remembered by the mnemonic S I T S:

Muscle	Origin	Insertion	Action	Nerve
Supraspinatus	Supraspinous fossa	Greater tubercle	Initiates abduction (0–15°)	Suprascapular nerve
Infraspinatus	Infraspinous fossa	Greater tubercle	External rotation	Suprascapular nerve
Teres Minor	Lateral border of scapula	Greater tubercle	External rotation & weak adduction	Axillary nerve
Subscapularis	Subscapular fossa	Lesser tubercle	Internal rotation	Upper & lower subscapular nerves
Functions of the Rotator Cuff

Maintains the humeral head centered in the glenoid cavity during movement

Provides dynamic stability to prevent dislocation

Supports overhead and throwing movements

Clinical Relevance

Most commonly injured: Supraspinatus (impingement).

External rotation weakness: Infraspinatus or teres minor injury.

Internal rotation weakness: Subscapularis tear.

Tendon degeneration increases with age.

2. Cranial Nerves — Expanded Notes

The 12 cranial nerves perform motor, sensory, and parasympathetic functions.
They are numbered I–XII from anterior to posterior.

I — Olfactory (Sensory)

Function: Smell

Location: Olfactory bulb → nasal mucosa

Clinical: Loss of smell (anosmia) in head trauma or COVID-19

II — Optic (Sensory)

Function: Vision

Pathway: Retina → optic nerve → chiasm → tract → cortex

Clinical: Field defects (e.g., bitemporal hemianopia from pituitary tumor)

III — Oculomotor (Motor + Parasympathetic)

Controls: Superior, inferior, medial rectus, inferior oblique, levator palpebrae

Parasympathetic: Pupil constriction

Clinical: “Down and out” eye + dilated pupil

IV — Trochlear (Motor)

Controls superior oblique muscle

Function: Intorsion + downward gaze

Clinical: Difficulty going downstairs (vertical diplopia)

V — Trigeminal (Sensory + Motor)

Sensation: Face, cornea, sinuses

Motor: Muscles of mastication

Clinical: Trigeminal neuralgia (severe facial pain)

VI — Abducens (Motor)

Controls lateral rectus

Function: Abducts eyeball

Clinical: Medial deviation (inability to abduct)

VII — Facial (Motor + Sensory + Parasympathetic)

Motor: Facial expression

Sensory: Taste anterior ⅔ tongue

Parasympathetic: Lacrimal & salivary glands

Clinical: Bell’s palsy

VIII — Vestibulocochlear (Sensory)

Vestibular: Balance

Cochlear: Hearing

Clinical: Vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss

IX — Glossopharyngeal (Mixed)

Taste posterior ⅓ tongue

Swallowing

Gag reflex (afferent limb)

Clinical: Loss of gag reflex

X — Vagus (Mixed + Parasympathetic)

Parasympathetic to heart, lungs, gut

Controls palate & larynx

Clinical: Uvula deviates away from lesion

XI — Accessory (Motor)

SCM: Head rotation

Trapezius: Shoulder elevation

Clinical: Drooping shoulder

XII — Hypoglossal (Motor)

Tongue movement

Clinical: Tongue deviates toward lesion
